                                My educational journey has been far from easy. Growing up, I faced numerous challenges, particularly financial struggles and family pressure. However, I was determined to push through and make the best of my circumstances. I completed my 10th grade from Swami Vivekanand School, Maharashtra, with an impressive 89.40%. Despite the hurdles I faced at home, I knew that education was my way out, and I remained focused on achieving academic success.

                                In my 12th grade, I chose the Science stream with a focus on MATHS (PCMB), which was a significant challenge given the pressure I was under. Not only did I have to juggle my studies with family responsibilities, but financial instability added to the weight. Nonetheless, I managed to score 89% in my 12th exams, which was a remarkable achievement considering the struggles I had to face. It was during this period that I learned the true meaning of perseverance, discipline, and hard work.
